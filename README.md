## 🧠 Project Description  

The **2025 Elections Voting Behavior Analysis of San Jose del Monte (SJDM), Bulacan** is a **data visualization and analytics project** that investigates the role of **demographics and generational turnout** in shaping electoral outcomes.  

SJDM has a population of **687,000** and **268,007 registered voters**. Out of **62 barangays**, **50 were analyzed**:  

- **26 barangays** from the First District  
- **24 barangays** from the Second District  

The project compares **pre-election surveys** with **official election results**, analyzing how **age, gender, and generational groups** influenced mayoral, vice-mayoral, senatorial, and councilor races in the city.

## 💼 Roles & Responsibilities  

- **Cleaned and processed** election data from **50 barangays**, fixing **120+ inconsistencies** and standardizing entries using **Google Sheets** and **Excel formulas**.  
  - Computed **measures of central tendency** and **variability**:  
    - **Gen Z** → Highest variability (**stdev = 12.4**)  
    - **Boomers** → Most consistent turnout (**stdev = 4.8**, **median = 61%**)  

- **Built an interactive Power BI dashboard** featuring:  
  - **4 generational filters** (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers)  
  - Drill-through analysis of **mayoral, vice-mayoral, senatorial, and councilor races**  
  - Comparative visuals of **dynastic vs. non-dynastic candidate support**  

- **Key findings**:  
  - **Millennials** averaged **58% support** for **non-dynastic candidates**  
  - **Boomers and Gen X** showed **65% support** for **incumbents**  
  - **Gen Z** exhibited **fragmented turnout** with shifting loyalties
